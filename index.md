## Introduction


Previously, there has been **no national standard** that sets out what appointment booking solutions should and should not be able to do. 

Historically UEC was provided locally & things like booking appointments & transferring care were dealt with locally/internally. This meant they were usually done using the same IT system, and local evolution gave rise to a largely heterogeneous IT infrastructure across the country. 

Later, the NHS 111 service (successor to the NHS Direct service) introduced a "national service, delivered locally" model of care & service provision to the UEC system. This introduced a disjoint between those services taking calls (NHS 111) and those taking appointments/providing care. The heterogeneous IT infrastructure became a blocker to successfully booking appointments and transferring patient care between services. 

Proprietary solutions were created to fill this gap and solve the appointment booking interoperability problem between services. However, there is a common list of issues and gaps that providers have identified around these solutions. The biggest gaps are currently:

* a lack of clearly defined appointment booking workflow that can be applied consistently across all services
* a lack of an appointment repository / index that allows services to easily find out if a patient already has an appointment booked
* a lack of business rules around how appointment booking should be handled when happening across regional borders (introduces financial, political, and accountability challenges).

System suppliers and providers alike have asked for standardisation of the appointment booking technical specification and workflow in urgent care.
