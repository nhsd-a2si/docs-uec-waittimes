## Introduction

This is a draft release of the proposed Live Wait Times data standards.

These standards will provide information on:

* How you should structure live wait time data
* How often you should submit data
* How you can submit the data to the DoS via the Capacity Service API

**These standards are being iterated currently, and so you should expect to see frequent changes for the time being.**
