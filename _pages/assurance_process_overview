## Assurance principles 
High-level design principles related to the assurance processes 
* assurance should be lightweight but appropriate 
* testing should be automated where possible to establish technical conformance 
* a level of self-certified solution assurance will be made available to organisations deploying the APIs 
* all artefacts related to assurance and testing should be made available as part of the ecosystem (public domain) prior to engaging in a formal NHS Digital assurance process 
* a set of evidence based around self-assurance activities will speed up the assurance process

Technical accreditation 

Technical conformance 

Solution assurance 

Witness testing 

 

Technical accreditation 

Provider systems SHALL be (or have previously been) tested and accredited to establish baseline Spine connectivity prerequisites: 

 

N3 connectivity / ASID / PKI Certificate 

Personal Demographic Service (PDS) integration 

Spine Directory Service (SDS) integration 

 

Technical conformance 

Provider systems SHALL be tested for technical conformance of the following before they can be listed on the product catalogue: 

Spine Security Proxy (SSP) integration 

Foundations 

 

Solution assurance 

Solution assurance ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation providing the APIs. 

 Important: Suppliers are responsible for their own testing and the clinical safety of the delivered system. Supplier-authored tests must be traceable back to the published specification. NHS Digital’s automated test suite is non-exhaustive and does not cover all test cases/scenarios required to pass solution assurance. NHS Digital expects to see evidence of more supplier authored tests in addition to the NHS Digital authored tests. 

 

Witness testing 

Provider systems SHALL undergo witness testing to validate conformance to requirements which can’t easily be automated.

Solution assurance 

Solution assurance ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation consuming the APIs.
