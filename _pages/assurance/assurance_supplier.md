## Technical accreditation 
Supplier systems **SHALL** be (or have previously been) tested and accredited to establish baseline Spine connectivity prerequisites: 
* N3 connectivity / ASID / PKI Certificate 
* Personal Demographic Service (PDS) integration 
* Spine Directory Service (SDS) integration 

## Technical conformance 
Supplier systems **SHALL** be tested for technical conformance of the following before they can be listed on the product catalogue: 
* Spine Security Proxy (SSP) integration 
* Other.....TBC

## Solution assurance 
Solution assurance ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation providing the APIs. 

 {% include important.html content="Suppliers are responsible for their own testing and the clinical safety of the delivered system. 
 Supplier-authored tests must be traceable back to the published specification. NHS Digital’s automated test suite is non-exhaustive and does not cover all test cases/scenarios required to pass solution assurance. 
 NHS Digital expects to see evidence of more supplier authored tests in addition to the NHS Digital authored tests." %}

## Witness testing 
Supplier systems **SHALL** undergo witness testing to validate conformance to requirements which can’t easily be automated.
