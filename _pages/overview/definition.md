### Definitions for Capacity and Demand

|Term             |Definition                                |

|Live / real time information| This is not a technical definition (see Non-functional Requirements for response time requirements).
Whenever the word "live" is suffixed to an operational measure, for example "live wait time" or "real time demand," it is meant to represent that the data item is real-time (or as close as possible to) from the point of view of the user receiving the information.  For this reason, in this project "live" and "real time" are defined using tolerances given by the users during research activities ? "How often should wait times be updated?"|
