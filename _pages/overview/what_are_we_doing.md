## Key Objectives

* Improve patient experience when booking an appointment through 111/CAS
* Single contact patient journey
* Reduce A&E Attendances
* Key recommendations made within the FYFV that the appointment booking standards project is committed to delivering include: 

    * Ensuring there is capability across all STPs for booking appointments at GP practices â€“ initially delivered through existing capability in the market but ultimately through open, standardised methods by December 2018

    * Enabling NHS 111 to book people into urgent face to face appointments where needed by December 2019

## Approach

These standards are being developed in a collaborative and agile way. Therefore, the standards and specifications will evolve, especially during first of type deployments.

## Working in conjunction with GP Connect

The GP Connect (GPC) programme has already developed a core national specification setting the standards for various capabilities including direct booking of electronic appointment between GP systems.    *LINK HERE*

The team are currently working with several suppliers to develop against the standards and to run pilots trialling various functionality covered by the GPC spec including booking appointments between GP Federations.  

The A2SI Urgent Care (UC) Appointment Booking project is committed and accountable to deliver the following FYFV UEC milestones:

    * Clear system in place across all STPs for booking appointments at particular GPs supported by improved technology, APIs, & clear standards

    * All services can support electronic booking directly between services 

The ability for NHS111 to book appointments directly into in hours GP services falls squarely into the remit of these commitments. 

There is considerable homogeneity in the direct booking requirements already captured and defined in the standards developed by GPC and in the requirements of an equivalent set of standards covering A2SI UEC settings. Therefore, an approach was previously agreed in which the A2SI team will utilise the GPC standards by providing UEC requirements to uplift the existing standards.  

To this end the A2SI programme has been working with GPC throughout the last year to identify, define, and embed, core requirements specific to UEC into the existing GPC specification to make it scalable to the wider UC space.  

To ensure the Appointments Management capability of the GPC specification supported Urgent Care (UC) providers (e.g. 111) booking patient appointments in to GP Practices the two teams came together to agree the functionality required.
