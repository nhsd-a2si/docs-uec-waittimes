## Vision

**By providing** capacity and demand information to Urgent and Emergency Care professionals

**Will** enable them to effectively and safely refer patients to the most clinically appropriate, convenient and available onward services, smoothing demand and improving expectations

**Because** it is possible to support choices with additional information on live delays, and achieve a reduction in patient delays accessing care

## Key Objectives

* **Publication of capacity and demand standards**, for sharing a common language to describe delays in accessing care for different settings. Although the basic building blocks are predetermined by the NHS Data Dictionary there is no national standard for sharing delays in accessing services.

* **Enable access to wait time information nationally to help provide a behavioural nudge**. In this Alpha, wait times are to be applied to the call handling 111 process, which aims to introduce a behavioural nudge after the phone triage in order to help patients choose the most appropriate service to meet their needs.

## Key Benefits
* Improve patient experience when using waiting time information via 111/CAS
* Reduce A&E Attendances

## Approach

These standards are being developed in a collaborative and agile way. Therefore, the standards and specifications will evolve, especially during first of type deployments.
